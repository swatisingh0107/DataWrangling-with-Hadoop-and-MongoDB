Sentiment Analysis is the analysis of body of text to identify and extract opinions expressed by the text. It is one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing(NLP).    

Opinion is typically extracted as a quantifiable sentiment called polarity often inferred as positive , negative or neutral sentiment. This polar sentiment is determined by the score of the polarity score.  

Sentiment analysis works best with subjective text than objective text. Opinions have two types: direct and comparative opinions. Direct opinions give a subjective expression about an entity directly while comparative opinions express similarities or differences between two or more entities using comparative or superlative form of an adjective or adverb.
