###  What is sentiment analysis  ?  
Sentiment Analysis is the analysis of body of text to identify and extract opinion bearing words or sentiments expressed by the text. It is one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing(NLP).    

Opinion is typically extracted as a quantifiable sentiment called polarity often inferred as positive , negative or neutral sentiment. This polar sentiment is determined by the score of the polarity score.  

Sentiment analysis works best with subjective text than objective text. Opinions have two types: direct and comparative opinions. Direct opinions give a subjective expression about an entity directly while comparative opinions express similarities or differences between two or more entities using comparative or superlative form of an adjective or adverb.  

Types of sentiment analysis
1. Fine-grained sentiment analysis: In this analysis, the bag of words is as important as the keyword itself. It expands the range of polarity between very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative.   
2. Emotion detection: maps the opinion text or words with words in lexicons or ontology to derive the emotion.  
3. Aspect-based sentiment analysis: Analyzes polarity as well as features or aspects of the products being discussed  
4. Intent analysis: performs intent classification as what customers will do with a product. This type of analysis is performed when the company wants to improve lead flow, reduce churn, target potential customers etc.  
5. Multilingual sentiment analysis: Performs text translation and then extracts the polarity score.
